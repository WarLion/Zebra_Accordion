##Zebra_Accordion

A tiny accordion jQuery plugin

Zebra_Accordion is a tiny (3KB minified) accordion jQuery plugin. It transforms a basic definition list, without requiring any other specific markup, into a small-footprint, easily configurable, fully customizable, cross-browser accordion widget, useful for better organizing larger groups of content.

##Features:

 - no additional markup required other than a basic definition list;
 - appearance is easily customizable through CSS;
 - works with both fixed and fluid (responsive) layouts;
 - can be configured so that only a single tab can be expanded at a time, or so that all tabs may be expanded/collapsed;
 - can be configured so that tabs expand on mouse over;
 - when, after expanding a tab, part of its content is outside the viewport, it automatically scrolls the browser’s window so that the tab’s content is visible;
 - callback functions can be used for further customizations;
 - works in all major browsers (Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer 6+)
